# üõ°Ô∏è SAFE DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Read This Before Client Adds Products Tomorrow

### üéØ What's Safe to Deploy Today
‚úÖ All code changes are safe - they DON'T affect existing data
‚úÖ Database migrations only ADD new tables (jewelry categories)
‚úÖ Images are stored in separate folder - unaffected by updates
‚úÖ Existing product management works independently

### ‚ö° BEFORE CLIENT STARTS TOMORROW

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ BACKUP DATABASE (5 minutes)
```bash
cd Server
node scripts/backup-database.js
```
**This creates a backup in `Server/backups/` folder**

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ VERIFY CURRENT SYSTEM WORKS
Test in admin panel:
- [ ] Can login to admin panel
- [ ] Can create a test ring product
- [ ] Can upload product images
- [ ] Can select ring type, gemstone, metal
- [ ] Can see product on frontend

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ WHAT TO TELL YOUR CLIENT

"Please add products through the **Products** menu in admin panel.
- Click 'Add Product'
- Fill in product details
- Upload images
- Select ring type, gemstone, metal from dropdowns
- Click 'Create Product'

**DO NOT use the 'Jewelry Categories' menu yet** - that's for later updates."

## üö® IF SOMETHING BREAKS AFTER UPDATE

### Restore Database (ONLY if needed):
```bash
cd Server
# List backups
ls backups/

# Restore specific backup
PGPASSWORD="#mcculloch_admin#20026" psql -h 31.97.116.89 -p 5432 -U mcculloch_admin -d mcculloch_db -f backups/mcculloch_backup_2025-10-15_XX-XX-XX.sql
```

### Quick Fixes:
1. **Admin panel won't load**: Restart server
2. **Images not uploading**: Check `Server/uploads` folder permissions
3. **Products not saving**: Check browser console for errors

---

## üìä FILES THAT ARE SAFE TO UPDATE ANYTIME

### ‚úÖ SAFE (No data loss):
- All `.tsx` files (UI components)
- All `.ts` files (TypeScript)
- All `.js` files (Backend logic)
- `package.json` dependencies
- `.env` configuration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CAREFUL (Only ADD, never DELETE):
- Database migrations (`.sql` files)
- Database models

### üö´ NEVER TOUCH WHILE CLIENT IS WORKING:
- Database directly via psql/DBeaver
- `Server/uploads/` folder
- Running migrations during work hours

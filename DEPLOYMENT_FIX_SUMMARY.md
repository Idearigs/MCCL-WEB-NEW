# Deployment Fix Summary - "Cannot find module" Errors

## Latest Problem (CRITICAL FIX - Commit d8131cd)

After fixing the server startup issues, the deployment was still failing with "Cannot find module 'bcrypt'" errors, despite Docker build successfully installing 845 packages.

### Root Cause: docker-compose.yml Override

**The Issue:**
1. Coolify's Docker build (using `Dockerfile`) successfully installed all packages
2. Build logs showed: `added 845 packages, and audited 846 packages in 7s` ✅
3. But then Coolify ran: `docker compose up --build -d`
4. This found `docker-compose.yml` which had `NODE_ENV: development` set
5. Docker rebuilt the image with development settings, overwriting the production build
6. Result: Packages installed during build, but missing at runtime ❌

**The Fix:**
- Renamed `docker-compose.yml` → `docker-compose.local.yml`
- Coolify can no longer find docker-compose configuration
- Now uses only the standalone `Dockerfile` for production
- No more conflicting rebuilds
- All packages will be available at runtime

**Commit:** d8131cd - "Fix production deployment by separating local and production Docker configs"

## Previous Fixes (Earlier Issues)

### Commit 1: Fix Health Check Path
**File:** `Server/Dockerfile`
- Changed health check from `/api/v1/health` to `/health`
- Health check was checking wrong endpoint

### Commit 2: Add Production CORS Origins
**File:** `Server/index.js`
- Added `https://buymediamonds.co.uk`
- Added `https://www.buymediamonds.co.uk`
- Added `https://api.buymediamonds.co.uk`
- Fixes CORS errors in production

### Commit 3: Resilient Server Startup (Most Important)
**Files:** `Server/config/database.js`, `Server/index.js`

**Changes:**
1. **Database retry logic** - Attempts to connect 3 times with 5-second delays
2. **Graceful degradation** - Server starts even if database fails
3. **Better logging** - Clear warnings about database status
4. **Health check enhancement** - Now reports database connection status

## What Happens Now

### Before (Old Behavior):
```
1. Server starts
2. Tries to connect to database
3. Database connection fails
4. process.exit(1) ❌
5. Container crashes
6. Health check fails
7. "No available server"
```

### After (New Behavior):
```
1. Server starts
2. Tries to connect to database (3 attempts)
3. Database connection fails
4. Server continues anyway ✅
5. HTTP server starts
6. Health check responds with database status
7. Container marked as "healthy"
8. Server accessible (with warning logs about DB)
```

## Next Steps - REDEPLOY NOW

### Step 1: Redeploy in Coolify
The latest commit (d8131cd) should be automatically detected. If not:
- Go to your API application in Coolify
- Click "Deploy" or trigger a manual deployment

**What will happen during deployment:**
- Coolify pulls latest code from GitHub
- Finds only `Dockerfile` (no docker-compose.yml)
- Builds with `npm install` → all 845 packages installed
- Runs container directly (no docker-compose override)
- Server starts with all packages available ✅

### Step 2: Check Container Logs
After deployment, check the logs. You should now see:
```
🚀 Server running in production mode on port 3000
⚠️  Server starting without database connection
⚠️  Database connection failed - check environment variables:
   - PG_HOST, PG_PORT, PG_DATABASE, PG_USERNAME, PG_PASSWORD
```

### Step 3: Test Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://api.buymediamonds.co.uk/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Server is running",
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "v1",
  "database": "disconnected",  // Will show "connected" once DB is fixed
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T..."
}
```

### Step 4: Fix Database Credentials
The server is now running but database is not connected. In Coolify, set these environment variables:

```bash
# PostgreSQL Configuration
PG_HOST=your-postgres-host         # ← Fix this
PG_PORT=5432
PG_DATABASE=mcculloch_db           # ← Fix this
PG_USERNAME=postgres               # ← Fix this
PG_PASSWORD=your-actual-password   # ← Fix this

# MongoDB Configuration (if using)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://your-host:27017/mcculloch_logs
```

### Step 5: Verify Database Connection
After setting correct credentials, the server will:
1. Try to connect on next restart (3 attempts)
2. If successful, database status changes to "connected"
3. All API endpoints become fully functional

Check health endpoint again:
```bash
curl https://api.buymediamonds.co.uk/health
```

Should now show:
```json
{
  "database": "connected"  // ✅ Success!
}
```

## Testing Frontend

Once server is up (even without database):
1. Frontend should no longer show CORS errors
2. Health check should respond
3. Database-dependent endpoints may still fail until DB is connected

Once database is connected:
- All jewelry category endpoints will work
- Navigation dropdowns will populate correctly
- All product data will load

## Key Files Changed

1. **Server/Dockerfile** - Health check path
2. **Server/index.js** - CORS origins + resilient startup
3. **Server/config/database.js** - Retry logic + no exit on failure

## Summary of All Fixes

✅ **docker-compose.yml renamed** - Prevents Coolify from using development config
✅ **Server will now start** even if database is unreachable
✅ **Health check works** regardless of database status
✅ **CORS configured** for production domains
✅ **Better error messages** in logs for debugging
✅ **All npm packages available** at runtime (845 packages)
⚠️ **Database credentials** - May need adjustment in Coolify environment variables

## Local Development

For local development with all services (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, pgAdmin):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```

The docker-compose configuration is now only for local development.

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://api.buymediamonds.co.uk/health

# Check specific API endpoint
curl https://api.buymediamonds.co.uk/api/v1/filters/earring-types

# Check CORS (from browser console)
fetch('https://api.buymediamonds.co.uk/health').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```
